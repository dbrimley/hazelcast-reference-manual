To prevent data loss when shutting down a cluster member, Hazelcast provides a graceful shutdown feature. You perform this shutdown by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`. 

Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, the master member migrates all of the replicas owned by the shutdown-requesting member to the other running (not initiated shutdown) cluster members. After these migrations are completed, the shutting down member will not be the owner or a backup of any partition anymore. It means that you can shutdown any number of Hazelcast members in a cluster concurrently with no data loss.

Please note that the process of shutting down members waits for a predefined amount of time for the master to migrate their partition replicas. You can specify this graceful shutdown timeout duration using the property `hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait`. Its default value is 10 minutes. If migrations are not completed within this duration, shutdown may continue non-gracefully and lead to data loss. Therefore, you should choose your own timeout duration considering the size of data in your cluster.

#### Ensuring Safe State with PartitionService

With the improvements in graceful shutdown procedure in Hazelcast 3.7, the following methods are not needed to perform graceful shutdown. Nevertheless, you can use them to check the current safety status of the partitions in your cluster.


```java
public interface PartitionService {
   ...
   ...
    boolean isClusterSafe();
    boolean isMemberSafe(Member member);
    boolean isLocalMemberSafe();
    boolean forceLocalMemberToBeSafe(long timeout, TimeUnit unit);
}
```

The method `isClusterSafe` checks whether the cluster is in a safe state. It returns `true` if there are no active partition migrations and all backups are in sync for each partition.

The method `isMemberSafe` checks whether a specific member is in a safe state. It checks if all backups of partitions of the given member are in sync with the primary ones. Once it returns `true`, the given member is safe and it can be shut down without data loss.

Similarly, the method `isLocalMemberSafe` does the same check for the local member. The method `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe` forces the owned and backup partitions to be synchronized, making the local member safe.
